# Google Appointments Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up Google Calendar integration for appointment booking on your Auto Universe website.

## üìã Overview

Your website now includes:

- **Appointment booking page** (`/appointments.html`)
- **Backend API** for handling appointments
- **Email notifications** for customers and dealership
- **Google Calendar integration** (optional)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install googleapis
```

### 2. Basic Setup (Email Only)

The simplest setup uses email notifications without Google Calendar:

1. Update your `.env` file:

```bash
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
DEALERSHIP_EMAIL=your-dealership@email.com
```

2. Start your server:

```bash
npm start
```

Your appointment booking will work with email notifications!

## üìÖ Google Calendar Integration (Advanced)

For full Google Calendar integration, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the Google Calendar API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Calendar API"
   - Click "Enable"

### Step 2: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
3. Configure OAuth consent screen if prompted
4. Select "Web application"
5. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground`
   - Your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)

### Step 3: Get Refresh Token

1. Go to [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground)
2. Click the gear icon (Settings)
3. Check "Use your own OAuth credentials"
4. Enter your Client ID and Client Secret
5. In the left panel, find "Calendar API v3"
6. Select: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
7. Click "Authorize APIs"
8. Complete the authorization flow
9. Click "Exchange authorization code for tokens"
10. Copy the refresh token

### Step 4: Update Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your-refresh-token
```

## üéØ Alternative: Google Calendar Appointment Slots

For a simpler approach, use Google Calendar's built-in appointment slots:

### Step 1: Create Business Calendar

1. Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)
2. Create a new calendar for appointments
3. Set business hours and availability

### Step 2: Enable Appointment Slots

1. In your business calendar, click "+ Create"
2. Select "Appointment schedule"
3. Configure:
   - Duration (e.g., 30 minutes)
   - Availability windows
   - Buffer time between appointments
   - Maximum bookings per slot

### Step 3: Get Embed Code

1. Go to calendar settings
2. Find "Integrate calendar" section
3. Copy the embed code
4. Replace the placeholder in `appointments.html`

Replace this section in `/public/appointments.html`:

```html
<!-- Replace this placeholder with your Google Calendar embed -->
<div class="calendar-embed mb-6">
  <iframe
    src="YOUR_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_EMBED_URL"
    style="border: 0"
    width="100%"
    height="500"
    frameborder="0"
    scrolling="no"
  >
  </iframe>
</div>
```

## üìß Email Configuration

### Gmail Setup

1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an app password:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security > App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
   - Use this password in your `.env` file

### Other Email Providers

Update the transporter configuration in `routes/appointments.js`:

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  host: "your-smtp-host",
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
});
```

## üîß API Endpoints

Your appointment system provides these endpoints:

- `POST /api/appointments` - Create new appointment
- `GET /api/appointments` - Get all appointments
- `GET /api/appointments/:id` - Get specific appointment
- `PATCH /api/appointments/:id/status` - Update appointment status
- `DELETE /api/appointments/:id` - Delete appointment
- `POST /api/appointments/send-email` - Send notification email

## üì± Frontend Features

The appointment booking page includes:

### Appointment Types

- Car Viewing
- Test Drive
- Financing Consultation
- General Inquiry

### Time Slots

- Pre-defined time slots (9 AM - 5 PM)
- Visual selection interface
- Availability checking

### Form Validation

- Required field validation
- Email format validation
- Phone number validation
- Date restrictions (future dates only)

## üé® Customization

### Styling

The appointment page uses Tailwind CSS. Customize in `appointments.html`:

- Colors: Change `bg-red-600` to your brand colors
- Layout: Modify grid layouts and spacing
- Components: Add/remove form fields

### Business Hours

Update time slots in `appointment-booking.js`:

```javascript
const timeSlots = [
  { time: "09:00", label: "9:00 AM" },
  { time: "10:00", label: "10:00 AM" },
  // Add more slots
];
```

### Email Templates

Customize email templates in `routes/appointments.js`:

- Customer confirmation emails
- Dealership notification emails
- Status update emails

## üö¶ Testing

### Test the Appointment System

1. Start your backend server
2. Open `/appointments.html` in your browser
3. Fill out the appointment form
4. Submit and check:
   - Database entry created
   - Email notifications sent
   - Google Calendar event created (if configured)

### Test Email Configuration

```bash
cd backend
node test-email.js
```

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Appointments are rate-limited to prevent spam
2. **Input Validation**: All form inputs are validated
3. **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for your domain
4. **Environment Variables**: Keep API keys secure
