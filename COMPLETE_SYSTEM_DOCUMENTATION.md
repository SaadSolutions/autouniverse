# Auto Universe Inc. - Complete System Documentation

## OVERVIEW

I have created a comprehensive full-stack dealership management system for Auto Universe Inc. This system consists of three main components:

1. **Frontend**: Modern web application with multiple pages for public users and dealers
2. **Backend**: RESTful API server with authentication, database management, and email integration
3. **Database**: MongoDB with structured schemas for cars, dealers, and loan applications

## WHAT I CREATED

### 1. BACKEND API SERVER (/backend/)

#### Core Files Created:

**server.js** - Main Express.js server file

- Sets up the web server on port 5000
- Configures middleware for security (helmet, CORS, rate limiting)
- Connects to MongoDB database
- Sets up API routes for authentication, cars, and forms
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Serves static files for uploaded car images

**package.json** - Node.js dependencies and scripts

- Express.js for web server framework
- Mongoose for MongoDB database interaction
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken for authentication tokens
- multer for file uploads
- nodemailer for email notifications
- Various security and validation packages

#### Database Models (/backend/models/):

**Dealer.js** - User accounts for dealers and admins

- Fields: email, password (hashed), name, role (admin/dealer), isActive, lastLogin
- Methods: password comparison, JSON serialization (removes password)
- Validation: email format, password length requirements

**Car.js** - Vehicle inventory management

## HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

### 1. AUTHENTICATION FLOW

1. **Dealer Access**: Dealers navigate to /dashboard.html
2. **Login Process**:
   - Frontend sends credentials to POST /api/auth/login
   - Backend validates credentials against hashed passwords in database
   - If valid, backend generates JWT token with dealer ID and role
   - Frontend stores token in localStorage for subsequent requests
3. **Protected Routes**:
   - All dealer-only endpoints require Authorization header with JWT token
   - Middleware verifies token and loads dealer information
   - Token expires after 24 hours for security

### 2. VEHICLE INVENTORY SYSTEM

1. **Public Browsing**:

   - Visitors can view all available cars via GET /api/cars
   - Frontend dynamically loads and displays cars with filtering
   - No authentication required for browsing

2. **Dealer Management**:

   - Authenticated dealers can add new vehicles via POST /api/cars
   - Form data and images processed by multer middleware
   - Images stored in /uploads/cars/ directory
   - Database stores image URLs and metadata

3. **Image Handling**:
   - Multiple images per vehicle supported
   - Automatic primary image selection
   - Image deletion and reordering capabilities
   - File validation for security and performance

### 3. LOAN APPLICATION PROCESS

1. **Customer Submission**:

   - Customers fill out comprehensive loan application form
   - Frontend validates all required fields before submission
   - Data sent to POST /api/forms/loan-application

2. **Backend Processing**:

   - Server validates all form fields using express-validator
   - Data stored in MongoDB with proper schema validation
   - Automatic email notification sent to dealer

3. **Email Integration**:

   - Uses nodemailer with Gmail SMTP
   - Sends formatted HTML email with application details
   - Tracks email delivery status in database

4. **Dealer Review**:
   - Dealers view applications in dashboard
   - Can update application status (pending, approved, denied, under_review)
   - View detailed applicant information

### 4. DATA PERSISTENCE

1. **MongoDB Database**:

   - Three main collections: dealers, cars, loanapplications
   - Mongoose ODM provides schema validation and relationships
   - Indexes for performance on commonly searched fields

2. **File Storage**:
   - Car images stored in local filesystem
   - Organized in /uploads/cars/ directory
   - Unique filenames prevent conflicts
   - URLs stored in database for retrieval

### 5. SECURITY MEASURES

1. **Authentication**:

   - JWT tokens with expiration
   - bcrypt password hashing with salt rounds
   - Role-based access control (admin/dealer)

2. **Input Validation**:

   - Server-side validation using express-validator
   - Mongoose schema validation
   - File upload restrictions and validation

3. **Rate Limiting**:

   - 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
   - Prevents abuse and DDoS attacks

4. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Controlled access from specific origins
   - Credential support for authenticated requests

### 6. API COMMUNICATION

1. **REST Architecture**:

   - Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - JSON request/response format
   - Consistent error handling and status codes

2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - JavaScript fetch API for HTTP requests
   - Promise-based async/await patterns
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages
