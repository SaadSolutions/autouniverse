2. Generate an app password
3. Use the app password in `EMAIL_PASS`

## Security Features

- JWT authentication with expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)

- CORS configuration
- Helmet for security headers

## Default Credentials

After seeding the database:

- **Admin:** admin@autouniverse.com / admin123
- **Dealer:** dealer@autouniverse.com / dealer123

## Production Deployment

1. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
2. Use a strong `JWT_SECRET`
3. Configure production MongoDB URI
4. Set up proper CORS origins
5. Use HTTPS
6. Consider using cloud storage for images (Cloudinary integration ready)

## Development Scripts

```bash
npm start          # Start production server
npm run dev        # Start development server with nodemon
npm run seed       # Seed database with sample data
```

## Error Handling

The API returns consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "error": "Error Type",
  "message": "Detailed error message",
  "messages": ["Array of validation errors"]
}
```

## API Response Format

Success responses follow this structure:

```json
